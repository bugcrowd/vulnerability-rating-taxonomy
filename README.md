# Bugcrowd VRT
The current VRT release is located at [https://bugcrowd.com/vrt](https://bugcrowd.com/vulnerability-rating-taxonomy) as both a searchable page and downloadable PDF.

The VRT is also available via our API. Documentation and examples of VRT API usage may be found [here](https://docs.bugcrowd.com/docs/vrt).

## Background
At the beginning 2016, we released the Bugcrowd Vulnerability Rating Taxonomy (VRT) to provide a baseline vulnerability priority scale for bug hunters and organizations. Over the past year and a half this document has evolved to be a dynamic and valuable resource for the bug bounty community.

In April 2017, we published formal contributor guidelines for the VRT, allowing us to more easily receive and transparently communicate about public feedback.

## Description
Bugcrowd's VRT outlines Bugcrowd's baseline technical severity rating – taking into account potential differences among edge cases – for common vulnerability classes. To arrive at this baseline technical severity rating for a given vulnerability, Bugcrowd's application security engineers started with the generally-accepted industry guideline and further considered the vulnerability's average acceptance rate, average priority, and frequency on business use case specific exclusions lists across all of Bugcrowd's programs.

Bugcrowd welcomes community feedback and direct contributions to the Bugcrowd VRT. We accept comments for public discussion via GitHub Issues, but can also accommodate comments made via email to [vrt@bugcrowd.com](mailto:vrt@bugcrowd.com). For more details see, [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/bugcrowd/vrt/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Anatomy of VRT Entries
Each top-level category entry contains one or more subcategory entries, and each subcategory entry may contain one or more variant entries used to differentiate subcases with different priority values. Some entries may have a `null` priority value – this represents that the priority varies based on context information.

### Types of VRT Entries
A VRT entry can be classified at up to three levels, including `Category`, `Sub-Category`, and `Variant`. Each classification level is nested within its parent and contains a set of definitions exclusive to its level.

#### Category
These comprise the top level of the VRT. They describe entire classes of vulnerabilities.

example: `Server-Side Injection`

#### Sub-Categories
Many Sub-Categories are nested within a Category. They describe individual vulnerabilities.

example: `Server-Side Injection > Remote Code Execution (RCE)`

#### Variants
Many Variants are nested within a Sub-Category. They describe specific sub-cases of an individual vulnerability.

example: `Server-Side Injection > SQL Injection > Blind`

### Data within an Entry
Within each entry is a set of data outlined below.

#### ID
Each ID – often the lowercase version of its name joined by `_` –  is unique among the children of its own parent. This is how VRT ID's can map between versions, such that an ID is only changed if it should not be identified with previous versions of that entry.

#### Name
The human-readable name of the vulnerability.

#### Priority
The priority represents Bugcrowd's suggested baseline technical severity of the vulnerability on a P1 (Critical) to P5 (Informational) scale.

- **P1**: Critical
- **P2**: High
- **P3**: Medium
- **P4**: Low
- **P5**: Informational

The technical severity of some vulnerabilities – as denoted in the taxonomy as "Varies" – is context-dependent. For example, the technical severity of an `Insecure Direct Object Reference` vulnerability is heavily dependent on the capabilities of the vulnerable function and other context information. Valid `Insecure Direct Object Reference` vulnerabilities can vary in priority from P4 to P1.

#### Children
Entries that are nested within another Entry. Only Categories or Sub-Categories can have children.

### Example
```json
{
  "id": "server_security_misconfiguration",
  "name": "Server Security Misconfiguration",
  "type": "category",
  "children": [
    {
      "id": "directory_listing_enabled",
      "name": "Directory Listing Enabled",
      "type": "subcategory",
      "children": [
        {
          "id": "non_sensitive_data_exposure",
          "name": "Non-Sensitive Data Exposure",
          "type": "variant",
          "priority": 5
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Deprecated node mapping
When breaking changes such as deletion/collapsing of IDs or moving to a different category occur, the `deprecated_node_mapping` will serve as a reference to find the latest ids for deprecated nodes.

**Any time such a breaking change occurs, it requires a new entry to be added to the deprecated_node_mapping**

#### Format
```json
{
  "deprecated_id": {
    "1.3": "new_id",
    "2.0": "newest_id"
  }
}
```

#### Example
```json
{
  "unvalidated_redirects_and_forwards.open_redirect.get_based_all_users": {
    "2.1": "unvalidated_redirects_and_forwards.open_redirect.get_based"
  },
  "unvalidated_redirects_and_forwards.open_redirect.get_based_authenticated": {
    "2.1": "unvalidated_redirects_and_forwards.open_redirect.get_based"
  },
  "unvalidated_redirects_and_forwards.open_redirect.get_based_unauthenticated": {
    "2.1": "unvalidated_redirects_and_forwards.open_redirect.get_based"
  }
}
```
